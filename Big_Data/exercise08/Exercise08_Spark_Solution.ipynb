    "\n",
    "YARN supports pluggable schedulers. The task of the scheduler is to share the resources of a large cluster among different tenants (applications) while trying to meet application demands (memory, CPU). A user may have several applications active at a time. "

    "1. Scalability : MapReduce has limited scalability, while YARN can scale to 10,000 nodes.\n",

    "3. Resource utilization : in MapReduce v1, the reducers wait on the mappers to finish (and vice-versa), leaving large fractions of time when either the reducers or the mappers are idle. Ideally all resources should be used at any given time.\n",
    "4. Flexibility : mapper and reducer roles are decided at configuration time, and cannot be reconfigured. "

Persisting RDDs on disk instead of memory is also possible.\n",

    "### 3.7 Spark Partitioning\n",
    "Spark programs can choose to control their RDDs' partitioning\n",
    "to reduce communication. Partitioning will not be helpful in all applications, for\n",
    "example, if a given RDD is scanned only once, there is no point in partitioning it in\n",
    "advance. It is useful only when a dataset is reused multiple times in key-oriented\n",
    "operations such as joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark's partitioning is available on all RDDs of key/value pairs, and causes the system\n",
    "to group elements based on a function of each key. Although Spark does not give\n",
    "explicit control of which worker node each key goes to (partly because the system is\n",
    "designed to work even if specific nodes fail), it lets the program ensure that a set of\n",
    "keys will appear together on some node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of Spark's operations involve shuffling data by key across the network. All of\n",
    "these will benefit from partitioning. Examples of operations that benefit from\n",
    "partitioning are `cogroup()`, `groupWith()`, `join()`, `leftOuterJoin()`, `rightOuterJoin()`, `groupByKey()`, `reduceByKey()`, `combineByKey()`, and `lookup()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default PySpark uses hash partitioning as the partitioning function. A way to define a custom partition is by using the function `partitionBy()`. To use `partitionBy()` the RDD must consist of tuple objects. This function is a transformation, therefore a new RDD will be returned. In the following example we are going to see a default partitioning scheme of Spark as well as a custom partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning allows some Spark code to run more efficiently, in particular running 'pair' operations on pair RDD (eg. mapValues, reduceByKey) is guaranteed to produce no shuffling in the cluster and also preserve the partitions."

    "### 3.8 Converting a user program into tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "A Spark driver is responsible for converting a user program into units of physical execution called tasks. At a high level, all Spark programs follow the same structure: they create RDDs from some input, derive new RDDs from those using transformations, and perform actions to collect or save data. A Spark program implicitly creates a logical **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of operations.\n",
    "When the driver runs, it converts this logical graph into a physical execution plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark performs several optimizations, such as \"pipelining\" map transformations together to merge them, and converts the execution graph into a set of **stages**.\n",
    "Each stage, in turn, consists of multiple tasks. The tasks are bundled up and prepared to be sent to the cluster. Tasks are the smallest unit of work in Spark; a typical user program can launch hundreds or thousands of individual tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each RDD maintains a pointer to one or more parents along with metadata about what\n",
    "type of relationship they have. For instance, when you call `val b = a.map()` on an\n",
    "RDD, the RDD `b` keeps a reference to its parent `a`. These pointers allow an RDD to be\n",
    "traced to all of its ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following phases occur during Spark execution:\n",
    "* User code defines a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of RDDs. Operations on RDDs create new RDDs that refer back to their parents, thereby creating a graph.\n",
    "* Actions force translation of the DAG to an execution plan. When you call an action on an RDD, it must be computed. This requires computing its parent RDDs as well. \n",
    "* Spark's scheduler submits a job to compute all needed RDDs. That job will have one or more stages, which are parallel waves of computation composed of tasks. Each stage will correspond to one or more RDDs in the DAG. A single stage can correspond to multiple RDDs due to pipelining.\n",
    "* Tasks are scheduled and executed on a cluster\n",
    "* Stages are processed in order, with individual tasks launching to compute segments of the RDD. Once the final stage is finished in a job, the action is complete.\n",
