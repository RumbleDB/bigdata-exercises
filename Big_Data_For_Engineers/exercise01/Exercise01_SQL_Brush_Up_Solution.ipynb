    "   - The number of concepts is limited, fixed, and well-defined.\n",

    "   - Attributes come from a well-defined domains with a fixed semantic (such as dates, e-mail addresses, ...).\n",

    "   - `released_by` does not contain non-key attributes, so it is in 3NF.\n",

    "   A very typical query is finding all the releases by an artist's name. If we redundantly store the artist's ID and name in `releases`, the aforementioned query now only requires a `SELECT` instead of an expensive `JOIN`. As releases can be released by multiple artists, we could also extend this idea and break 1NF by storing a list of artist names instead. The tradeoff here is that every time we have to update an artist's name we have to find and update all releases by that artist. Considering that reads are very common and changes are rare, the option of denormalizing becomes relatively more attractive.\n",
    "\n",

       " Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]&quot; (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]&#x27;s expressive singing. The album featured the hits &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High &amp; Dry[/url]&quot;, &quot;[r=1463625]&quot; and &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]&quot;. \r",

       " The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]&quot; (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990&#x27;s, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]&quot; (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.\r",

       " &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Hail-To-The-Thief/master/16962]Hail To The Thief[/url]&quot; (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]&quot; (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  &quot;[url=https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/master/998252]A Moon Shaped Pool[/url]&quot;, was released in May 2016.\r",

    "### Exercise 4: Solution\n",
    "1. Most queries consist of the following basic operations. They will reoccur throughout the whole semester. Watch out for them!\n",
    "  * **Select**: select a subset of the rows/data records/items.\n",
    "  * **Project**: select a subset of the properties/ attributes/columns.\n",
    "  * **Join**: bring two datasets together based on a common attribute.\n",
    "  * **Group**: divide the items/ rows/records into groups and summarize each group with a single value.\n",
    "  * **Order**: order the items according to some criteria.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Relational algebra operators formalize most of this (grouping is technically not part of the algebra).\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. We only describe *what* we want, not how this should be computed. We *declare* what our intent is. This shifts the implementation effort from the programmer to the database system. The hope is that the system has more information at hand, such as data size, data distribution, information about the hardware, in order to choose the best way to compute the result. This results into efficient computation with little effort from the programmer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. SQL is functional because results of a query can be used as input of another query, either in form of tables or in form of scalars. This makes SQL expressive."
