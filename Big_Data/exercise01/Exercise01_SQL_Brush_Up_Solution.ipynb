    "### Exercise 1: Solution\n",
    "1. Which concepts are modelled in the dataset and how do they relate to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The dataset contains data from `discogs` and models musical artists, their physical releases, and the tracks on those releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The data is stored as tables. Why was this shape chosen and why not the other shapes?\n",
    "   - The number of concepts is limited, fixed, and well-defined.\n",
    "   - The same is true for attributes of these concepts.\n",
    "   - Attributes come from a well-defined domains with a fixed semantic (such as dates, e-mail addresses, ...).\n",
    "   - Instances of concepts are in relation with each other, which may or may not be required to exist.\n",
    "   - In short: we can define a schema, which the rest of the application (the website) relies on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In which normal forms are the corresponding relations?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - All relations are atomic so they are in 1NF.\n",
    "   - `artists` and `releases` both have a singular ID primary key, so they at least 2NF. Upon inspection, there are no transitive dependencies, so they are in 3NF.\n",
    "   - `released_by` does not contain non-key attributes, so it is in 3NF.\n",
    "   - `tracks` has a foreign key constraint but no primary key constraint (although this is not captured by normal forms). The reason is likely because the data is crowd-sourced and archival, and there could be duplicate entries in the database.\n",

    "   - How often do we need to update artists?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   A very typical query is finding all the releases by an artist's name. If we redundantly store the artist's ID and name in `releases`, the aforementioned query now only requires a `SELECT` instead of an expensive `JOIN`. As releases can be released by multiple artists, we could also extend this idea and break 1NF by storing a list of artist names instead. The tradeoff here is that every time we have to update an artist's name we have to find and update all releases by that artist. Considering that reads are very common and changes are rare, the option of denormalizing becomes relatively more attractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What potential problems could result from denormalizing the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Insert anomaly: we could insert a release with a fake or incorrect artist name.\n",

    "\n",
    "The query from the question, however, is independent of this number. You can just change `X` and leave the rest as it is. The trick is that it is a *recursive* SQL statement. Roughly speaking, a recursive statement consists of a base case statement connected via ```UNION``` (a concatenation of relations) with a statement the refers to the original statement. The recursive statement is executed recursively until it produces an empty result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query uses this mechanism to write ```X_hop_collaborations``` (repeated in isolation below): its base case are the direct `collaborations`. Each iteration joins the `collaborations` relation to find artists within one more hop for each artist already found. It keeps track of the distance from the original post by incrementing the value of ```distance``` by one in each iteration. When that attribute reaches the value of ```X```, no records are produced by the recursive case, so recursion ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider: we have to join `collaborations` with an exponentially growing relation for each hop. In addition to the query being difficult to write, it becomes very inefficient as `X` increases."
