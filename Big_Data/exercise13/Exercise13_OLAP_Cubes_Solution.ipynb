    "### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which table(s) of the TPC-H schema is/are the fact table(s)?**  \n",
    "   It depends on what we want to analyze, i.e., it depends on which cube we define on the tables.\n",
    "   In general, the fact table is the table that contains the measure(s).\n",
    "   If we analyze orders, then the order is the fact table.\n",
    "   We could also analyze line items, in which case we probably want information of the order each item belongs to as well,\n",
    "   so we would take the join of lineitem and orders as fact table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is/are the measure(s)?**  \n",
    "   As we have seen in the lecture, there can be more than one measure in one fact table. \n",
    "   Fact tables often contain many different measures\n",
    "   and it makes sense to have a cube with several of them at the same time\n",
    "   (for example, revenue, profit, net price, and gross price).\n",
    "   For example, in the table *lineitems*, quantity, extendedprice, discount, and tax can be used as measures;\n",
    "   in *orders*, totalprice; in *partsupp*, availqty and supplycost;\n",
    "   in *part*, retailprice; and in *customer* and *supplier*, acctbal.\n",
    "   Intuitively, if it makes sense to calculate the sum or average of an attribute,\n",
    "   then we can probably use it as measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the dimensions?**  \n",
    "   All other attributes (except keys, which are only an artifact of normalization).\n",
    "   Some of them have explictly materialized hierarchies, such as the geographical hierarchy for nation and regions.\n",
    "   The time dimension is also hierarchical, but the tables do not materialize it explictly:\n",
    "   each date can be broken down into year, quarter, month, week, etc.\n",
    "   Dimensions are typically discrete values. \n",
    "   Another way to look at it is:\n",
    "   if it makes sense to have a foreign key to another table instead of an inline attribute,\n",
    "   then the attribute is a dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What do you call this flavor of OLAP?**  \n",
    "   If the data is stored and presented as relations, we speak of \"Relational OLAP\" (ROLAP).\n",
    "   If, instead, cubes are primary citizens in a system optimized for multidimensional analysis,\n",
    "   we speak of \"Multidimensional OLAP\" (MOLAP).\n",
    "   Since Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) is designed for cubes and SQL is not, we need to note the following:\n",
    "   1. MDX better suited in terms of language; in SQL, a programmer needs to map cube concepts to relations him/herself.\n",
    "   1. The result of an MDX query is directly presented as cube,\n",
    "      whereas postprocessing is needed to get roll-ups out of a SQL query.\n",
    "   1. Execution of roll-up queries is potentially more efficient in an engine that is aware of grouping sets\n",
    "      (which is the case for many advance SQL-based systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "   So, while there is a certain competance mismatch between MDX and SQL, it is relatively small.\n",
    "   As we will see in the following exercises, the translation of cube concepts to SQL is *relatively* easy.\n",
    "   Also, in practice, MDX might not be available (we did not find a proper free tool for you to try MDX, unfortunately)."

    "\n",
    "Discuss the terms \"slice and dice\", \"drill down\", \"roll up\", and \"pivoting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Slice and dice:**  \n",
    "  The terms might let you think of cooking. Indeed, they have their roots in cooking and describes the cutting skills in different granularities. To slice means to cut and to dice means to cut into very small uniform sections and the two actions are often performed sequentially. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  In cube operations, a slice is a term for a subset of the data, generated by picking a value for one dimension and only showing the data for that value (for instance only the data at one point in time). See pg. 45 in the lecture slides, (\"2016\", \"CH\", \"Server\") is the smallest slice one can have from that cube. \n",
    "  By filter some of the facts, we only look at a particular \"slice\" of the cube.\n",
    "  For example, in the next question, we will first analyze revenue from all regions and then only consider the \"slice\" for Africa.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  By selecting dimensions, we decide which surfaces of the cube to show, i.e., we \"dice\" it. Oftentimes, a dice operation involves an aggregation.\n",
    "  For example, we showed the regions as columns and the years as rows. \n",
    "  Let us refer to pg. 56 in the lecture slides. Here, we have the slicers of \"server\", \"world\" and \"USD\", then we dice the cube by aggregating the measure (e.g., revenue) along the dimensions of salespersons (\"Mary\" and \"Peter\") and years (2014, 2015, 2016). \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Drill-down:**  \n",
    "  Oftentimes, we want information on the various levels of granularity presented together. Typically, we do this in a hierarchical manner: we show results in a broader category first, and then narrower ones. \n",
    "  For instance, in the next task, we will look at revenue per region first, then we will \"zoom in\" in the subsequent steps to see the revenue per nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Roll-up:**  \n",
    "  Roll-up is an inverse of drill-down. In roll-up, we may want to first have summaries in the most fine-grained view.\n",
    "  While we first look at the revenue on a week granularity, we may want to see the summary per month and quarter at the same time/in the same table.\n",
    "  The subtotals shown in the pivot table \"roll up\" that information.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Pivoting:** \n",
    "  Pivoting allows us to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces, by changing the positions of dimensions. \n",
    "  Then, we look at the cube from a different angle, i.e., we rotate (\"pivot\") it.\n",
