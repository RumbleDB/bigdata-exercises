    "To install the latest version of RumbleDB locally, you can follow the steps given on the official rumbledb website: \n",
    "https://rumble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting%20started/\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow very carefully the instructions of [Method 1](https://rumble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting%20started/#method-1-with-the-large-standalone-rumbledb-jar-experimental), in particular, download the big jar and execute it with the normal `java -jar` instruction, with Java 8 or 11. You can put the jar file in the working directory of this week. \n",
    "\n",
    "To launch a JSONiq shell with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`java -jar rumbledb-1.20.0-standalone.jar repl`\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives access to the RumbleDB shell where you can try commands. Note that to run each command, you should press 'Enter' two times, and you can quit with 'exit'. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to make sure the Java version is correct and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is correctly set. \n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., on MacOS, (1) you can set `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)`; or (2) export `JAVA_HOME` to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home/` or similar. On Linux/Windows OS there are similar methods to set `JAVA_HOME`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 2: Github codespaces\n",
    "If the local installation does not work for you, please use this option. \n",
    "See this [tutorial](https://cloud.inf.ethz.ch/s/KHLnq9HsQHfLHHQ/download) for running RumbleDB on Github codespaces. \n"

    "As explained on the [official JSON Web site](http://www.json.org/), JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format designed for humans as well as for computers. It supports as values:\n",
    "- objects (string-to-value maps)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Elevator Pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "JSONiq is based on XQuery, which is a W3C standard (like XML and HTML). XQuery is a very powerful declarative language that originally manipulates XML data, but it turns out that it is also a very good fit for manipulating JSON natively.\n",
    "JSONiq, since it extends XQuery, is a very powerful general-purpose declarative programming language. Our experience is that, for the same task, you will probably write about 80% less code compared to imperative languages like JavaScript, Python or Ruby. Additionally, you get the benefits of strong type checking without actually having to write type declarations.\n",

    "The [Great Language Game](http://greatlanguagegame.com/) is a game in which you are given a voice clip to listen, and you are asked to identify the language in which the person was speaking. It is a multiple-choice question–you make your choice out of several alternatives.\n",
