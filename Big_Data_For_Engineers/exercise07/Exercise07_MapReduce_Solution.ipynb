    "## 0. The two APIs for MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce provides two different interfaces: the **native MapReduce API** and the **Streaming API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The native MapReduce API is equivalent to the one seen in class. To use it, the user has to write two Java classes: one for the Mapper function and one for the Reducer function. Just like in the logical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Mapper function takes a KeyValue pair and emits zero or more KeyValue pairs;\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function map(key, value)\n",
    "  // Do some work\n",
    "  emit(someKey, someValue)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- and the Reducer function takes a key and a collection of values, and emits zero or more KeyValue pairs (usually one). \n",
    "```js\n",
    "function reduce(key, values[])\n",
    "  // Do some work\n",
    "  emit(key, aggregatedValue)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "The Streaming API is usually slower, but allows users to write the Mapper and the Reducer functions in any language — even different languages.\n",
    "To use the API we need to write two functions, a mapper and a reducer. In this case, however, the programs will directly read the KV pairs as a sequence of lines from standard input and write the resulting KV pairs to standard output.\n",
    "The streaming API will take care of all the parallelization, the shuffling and everything else required.\n",
    "Since the operations are done using the standard input and standard output, there are two differences with the logical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The KV pairs are not independently processed, but read all **sequentially** from standard input.\n",
    "2. The reducer task does not receive a key with a list of values, but the **ordered list** of KV pairs (one per line). Therefore, the reducer must therefore implement itself the logic for handling a new key. "

    "\n",
    "To run a MapReduce job we need of course a mapper function and a reducer. Usually to run natively on Hadoop we need to write our mapper and reducer as classes in Java, but to make the development easier and less cumbersome we are going to use the **Hadoop streaming API**.  \n",
    "This wonderful API allows the developers to write code in any language and integrate it seamlessly with the MapReduce framework.  \n",
    "We just need to provide 2 scripts—one for the mapper, one for the reducer—and let them read the KeyValues from `stdin` (the default input stream) and write them to `stdout` (the default output stream). Hadoop will take care of parallelization, the sort step and everything else required.  \n",

    "After that if the word is equal to the previous one (remember the kv pairs are sorted so all the same words will be together) we just increase the count for that word by one, otherwise we print the current word with the associated count and move to the next word."
