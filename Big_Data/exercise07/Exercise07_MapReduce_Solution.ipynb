    "1. Since the output of mapper and reducer must be serializable, they have to implement the [Writable interface](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/io/Writable.html). Additionally, the key classes have to implement the [WritableComparable interface](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/io/WritableComparable.html) to facilitate sorting by the framework. Hadoop provides classes implementing these interfaces for string, boolean, integers, long and short values.\n",
    "1. Mapper and Reducers are identity functions. Since there is always a shuffling phase, the overall job performs sorting by input key.\n",
    "1. [Context](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0-alpha2/api/index.html) allows the Mapper/Reducer to interact with the rest of the Hadoop system. It includes configuration data for the job and the methods for mapper and reducer to emit output (`write()`). Applications can also use the Context to set parameters to mappers and reducers runnning on different nodes."

This might be a bad choice in terms of performance, but on the other hand the result will be on a single file, without further merging necessary.\n",

    "1. Generally, one reducer might become a bottleneck. In this case, the bottleneck is more evident if no combiner is used. However, using multiple reducers, multiple output files will be created and an additional merging step is necessary to get the same result. Note: according to the official documentation, the right number of reduces is 0.95 or 1.75 multiplied by [no. of nodes] * [no. of maximum containers per node].\n",
    "With 0.95 all of the reduces can launch immediately and start transferring map outputs as the maps finish. With 1.75 the faster nodes will finish their first round of reduces and launch a second wave of reduces doing a much better job of load balancing. The scaling factors above are slightly less than whole numbers to reserve a few reduce slots in the framework for speculative-tasks and failed tasks."
