    "This configuration is theoretically impossible with a sound hash function. The hashes of $B$ and $C$, respectively, are identical across the trees. Yet, the hash of node $A$ does not match. This would imply that our hash function can give two different results from the exact same input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem of the trees can be seen in node $C$. Both trees have the same value for node $C$, yet the hash of one of the children (node $G$) is different across trees. This is theoretically possible since hash functions generally have non-zero collision probability (i.e., the same hash value can be obtained from two different inputs). In practice, this is extremely unlikely, but may lead to unnecessary exchanges/synchronization."
