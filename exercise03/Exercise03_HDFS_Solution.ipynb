    "## 1. The Hadoop Distributed File System\n",
    "### 1.1 &ndash; State which of the following statements are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HDFS namespace is a hierarchy of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In HDFS, each block of the file is either 64 or 128 megabytes depending on the version and distribution of Hadoop in use, and this *cannot* be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A client wanting to write a file into HDFS, first contacts the NameNode, then sends the data to it. The NameNode will write the data into multiple DataNodes in a pipelined fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A DataNode may execute multiple application tasks for different clients concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cluster can have thousands of DataNodes and tens of thousands of HDFS clients per cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HDFS NameNodes keep the namespace in DRAM and on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The locations of block replicas are part of the persistent checkpoint that the NameNode stores in its local file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the block size is set to 64 megabytes, storing a file of 80 megabytes will actually require 128 megabytes of physical memory (2 blocks of 64 megabytes each). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, in contrast with the Object Storage logic model, HDFS is designed to handle a relatively small amount of huge files. A hierarchical file system can therefore be handled efficiently by a single NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the default size is either 64 or 128 megabytes but this can be easily changed in the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the client writes data to the DataNodes. No data goes through the NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, each DataNode may execute multiple application tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, since each DataNode can execute multiple tasks concurrently, there may be more clients than DataNodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, and an image of such namespace is also persisted on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the locations of block replicas may change over time and are not part of the persistent checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the size of the data file equals the actual length of the block and does not require extra space to round it up to the nominal block size as in traditional file systems. Therefore 80 megabytes will be stored as a block of 64 megabytes + a block of 16 megabytes."

    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical size for a block is either 64 or 128 megabytes. A large block size offers several important advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It minimizes the cost of seeks. If the block is large enough, the time it takes to transfer the data from the disk can be significantly longer than the time to seek to the start of the block. Thus, transferring a large file made of multiple blocks operates at the disk transfer rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It reduces clients' need to interact with the NameNode because reads and writes on the same block require only one initial request to the NameNode for location information. The reduction is significant for workloads where applications mostly read and write large files sequentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since on a large block, a client is more likely to perform many operations on the given block, it can reduce network overhead by keeping a persistent TCP connection to the DataNode over an extended period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. It reduces the size of the metadata stored on the NameNode. This allows us to keep the metadata in memory."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linearly**. HDFS is designed taking machine failure into account, and therefore DataNodes do not need to be (highly expensive) highly reliable machines. Instead standard commodity hardware can be used. Moreover the number of nodes can be increased as soon as it becomes necessary, avoiding wasting of resources when the amount of data is still limited. This is indeed the main advantage of scaling out compared to scaling up, which has exponential cost growth.\n",

    "1. What is the Secondary NameNode?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prior to Hadoop 2.0.0, the **NameNode was a single point of failure**. While the loss of any other machine (intermittently or permanently) does not result in data loss, NameNode loss results in cluster unavailability. The permanent loss of NameNode data would render the cluster's HDFS inoperable.\n",
    "The HDFS High Availability feature addresses the above problems by providing the option of running two redundant NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Secondary NameNode is a node that merges the fsimage and the edits log files periodically and keeps edits log size within a limit. This allows the NameNode to start up faster in case of failure, but the Secondary NameNode is not a redundant NameNode. Over the years, the HDFS team kept improving on the \"alternative\" name nodes and came up almost every year with a new name with new functionality improving on the former ones. In the lecture, we discuss the latest up-to-date variant, standby namenodes, saying all the others (secondary, checkpoint, backup...) are just \"HDFS archeology\". For the possible configurations of namenodes, see [the official HDFS user guide](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html#Secondary_NameNode). "

By adding more DataNodes the storage capacity of the system can be increased arbitrarily. It has been demonstrated to scale beyond tens of petabytes (PB). More importantly, it does so with linear performance characteristics and cost.\n",

    "Assume your HDFS cluster is made of 3 racks, each containing 3 DataNodes. Assume also the HDFS is configured to use a block size of 100 megabytes and that a client is connecting from outside the datacenter (therefore no DataNode is priviledged). \n",

    "1. The client uploads a file of 150 megabytes. Draw in the picture below a possible blocks configuration according to the default HDFS replica policy. How many replicas are there for each block? Where are these replicas stored?\n",

    "1. Can you find a different policy that, using the same number of replicas, improves the expected availability of a block? Does your solution show any drawbacks?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Referring to the picture below, assume a block is stored in Node 3, as well as in Node 4 and Node 5. If this block of data has to be processed by a task running on Node 6, which of the three replicas will be actually read by Node 6? \n",

    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each block independently, the HDFS's placement policy is to put one replica on a random node in a random rack, another on one node in a different rack, and the last on a different node in the same rack chosen for the second replica. A possibile configuration is shown in the picture (but there are many more valid solutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One could decide to store the 3 replicas in 3 different racks, increasing the expected availability. However this would also slow down the writing process that would involve two inter-rack communications instead of one. Usually, the probability of failure of an entire rack is much smaller than the probability of failure of a node and therefore it is a good tradeoff to have 2/3 of the replicas in one rack.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Either the one stored in Node 4 or Node 5, assuming the intra-rack topology is such that the distance from these nodes to Node 6 is the same. In general, the reading priority is only based on the distance, not on which node was first selected in the writing process.\n",
