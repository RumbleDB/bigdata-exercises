    "MongoDB supports indexes that contain either a single field or multiple fields depending on the operations that this index type supports. \n",

    "### Managing indexes in MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "An ```explain``` operator provides information on the query plan. It returns a document that describes the process and indexes used to return the query. This may provide useful insight when attempting to optimize a query.\n",
    "\n",
    " ```db.restaurants.find({\"borough\" : \"Brooklyn\"}).explain()```\n",

    "In the mongo shell, you can create an index by calling the ```createIndex()``` method.  \n",

    " ```db.restaurants.createIndex({ \"borough\" : 1 })```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you retrieve a new query plan for indexed data.\n",
    "```db.restaurants.find({\"borough\" : \"Brooklyn\"}).explain()```\n",
    "The value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of 1 specifies an index that orders items in ascending order. A value of -1 specifies an index that orders items in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove all indexes, you can use ```db.collection.dropIndexes()```. To remove a specific index you can use ```db.collection.dropIndex()```, such as ```db.restaurants.dropIndex({ borough : 1 })```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write an index that will speed up the following query:\n",
