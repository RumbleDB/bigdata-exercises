    "## 1. The Hadoop Distributed File System\n",
    "### 1.1 &ndash; State which of the following statements are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HDFS namespace is a hierarchy of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All blocks of a file in HDFS are stored sequentially on a single disk for faster access.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A client wanting to write a file into HDFS, first contacts the NameNode, then sends the data to it. The NameNode will write the data into multiple DataNodes in a pipelined fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A DataNode may execute multiple application tasks for different clients concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the block size is set to 64 megabytes, storing a file of 80 megabytes will actually require 128 megabytes of physical memory (2 blocks of 64 megabytes each). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cluster can have thousands of DataNodes and tens of thousands of HDFS clients per cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HDFS NameNodes keep the namespace in DRAM and on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The locations of block replicas are part of the persistent checkpoint that the NameNode stores in its local file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, in contrast to the Object Storage logic model, HDFS is designed to handle a relatively small amount of huge files. A hierarchical file system can therefore be handled efficiently by a single NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, blocks are distributed across multiple DataNodes for fault tolerance and parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the client writes data to the DataNodes. No data goes through the NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, each DataNode may execute multiple application tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the size of the data file equals the actual length of the block and does not require extra space to round it up to the nominal block size as in traditional file systems. Therefore 80 megabytes will be stored as a block of 64 megabytes + a block of 16 megabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, since each DataNode can execute multiple tasks concurrently, there may be more clients than DataNodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, and an image of such namespace is also persisted on disk.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical size for a block is either 64 or 128 megabytes. A large block size offers several important advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It reduces the size of the metadata stored on the NameNode. This allows us to keep the metadata in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It minimizes the proportion of time spent seeking (i.e. moving the read/write head to the correct position on the disk). The seek time is a constant overhead for each block of data you want to access. Using large blocks ensures that after the initial seek, the system can continuously transfer large amounts of data at the disk's full transfer rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It reduces clients' need to interact with the NameNode because reads and writes on the same block require only one initial request to the NameNode for location information. The reduction is significant for workloads where applications mostly read and write large files sequentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since on a large block, a client is more likely to perform many operations on the given block, it can reduce network overhead by keeping a persistent TCP connection to the DataNode over an extended period of time. \n"

    "\n",
    "1. Why is the NameNode a single point of failure?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is this problem addressed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HDFS is designed taking machine failure into account, and therefore DataNodes do not need to be (highly expensive) highly reliable machines. Instead standard commodity hardware can be used. Moreover the number of nodes can be increased as soon as it becomes necessary, avoiding wasting of resources when the amount of data is still limited. This is indeed the main advantage of scaling out compared to scaling up, which has exponential cost growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prior to Hadoop 2.0.0, the **NameNode was a single point of failure**. While the loss of any other machine (intermittently or permanently) does not result in data loss, NameNode loss results in cluster unavailability. If the NameNode data is permanently lost, all the data on the cluster is lost, because it is not possible to reassemble the blocks into files any more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HDFS High Availability feature provides the option of running two redundant (or more, as of Hadoop 3.0.0) NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. This allows a fast failover to a new NameNode in the case that a machine crashes, or a graceful administrator-initiated failover for the purpose of planned maintenance."

    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",

    "1. By partitioning files into blocks and distributing them to many servers operating in parallel, HDFS can scale to potentially a large number of files of any size. By adding more DataNodes the storage capacity of the system can be increased arbitrarily. It has been demonstrated to scale beyond tens of petabytes (PB). More importantly, it does so with linear performance characteristics and cost.\n",

    "1. HDFS creates multiple copies of each block (by default 3, on different racks) to minimize the probability of data loss.\n",
