    "\n",
    "1. The HDFS namespace is a hierarchy of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In HDFS, each block of the file is either 64 or 128 megabytes depending on the version and distribution of Hadoop in use, and this *cannot* be changed.\n",

    "1. A DataNode may execute multiple application tasks for different clients concurrently.\n",

    "1. The cluster can have thousands of DataNodes and tens of thousands of HDFS clients per cluster.\n",

    "1. HDFS NameNodes keep the namespace in RAM.\n",

    "1. The locations of block replicas are part of the persistent checkpoint that the NameNode stores in its native file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the block size is set to 64 megabytes, storing a file of 80 megabytes will actually require 128 megabytes of physical memory (2 blocks of 64 megabytes each). "
