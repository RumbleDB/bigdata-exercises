    "\n",
    "1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the left menu, click on \"Create a resource\", search for \"azure PostgreSQL\", then select \"Azure Database for PostgreSQL\", click \"create\" and finally create the  'single server'.\n",
    "2. Select a subscription, then create a new resource group, which you may call \"exercise01\". Choose a unique server name (e.g. \\<your-name>-bd2020), select 'West Europe' as location.\n",

    "You should see the PostgreSQL server in the list. The deployment may take some time. You can check its progress by clicking on the bell symbol in the top right menu.\n",
