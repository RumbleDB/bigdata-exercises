At a high level, all Spark programs follow the same structure: they create RDDs from some input, derive new RDDs from those using transformations, and perform actions to collect or save data. A Spark program implicitly creates a logical **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of operations.\n",
    "When the driver runs, it converts this logical graph into a physical execution plan.\n",

    "Spark performs several optimizations, such as \"pipelining\" map transformations together to merge them, and converts the execution graph into a set of **stages**.\n",

    "* Actions force translation of the DAG to an execution plan. When you call an action on an RDD, it must be computed. This requires computing its parent RDDs as well. \n",
    "* Spark's scheduler submits a job to compute all needed RDDs. That job will have one or more stages, which are parallel waves of computation composed of tasks. Each stage will correspond to one or more RDDs in the DAG. A single stage can correspond to multiple RDDs due to pipelining.\n",

    "[TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is a statistic to determine the relative importance of the words in a set of documents. Is is computed as the product of two statistics, term frequency (`tf`) and inverse document frequency (`idf`). \n",

This gives us some information about the content of a document but because some terms (eg. \"the\") are so common, term frequency will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word \"the\" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse document frequency `idf(t, D)` is a measure of how much information the word provides, that is, whether the term is common or rare across all documents. It can be computed as:\n",
