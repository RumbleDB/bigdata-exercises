Before starting, make sure oXygen is installed and working on your computer. You can download the required licence from the [ETH IT shop](https://itshop.ethz.ch/EndUser/Items/Home):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login with your ETH credentials\n",

    "2. Click on `+ CREATE REQUEST` in the top right, select **Software and Business Applications** and go to **Software & Licenses** > **Order Software Product**.\n",

    "5. Wait until you get the confirmation email (it should take a couple of minutes). Simply download the __license file__, and then download the software from the [official website](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/software_archive_editor.html), and proceed with the installation. You should get asked to copy the __license file__ at some point.\n",

    "Correct the following JSON documents to be well-formed. Try first to \"parse\" them in your mind manually, then use oXygen to check your solutions.\n",

    "#### **Solution**\n",
    "1. `age` key must be double quoted.\n",

    "3. `is verified` and `phoneNumbers` should be double quoted.\n",

    "*Best practices:*\n",

    "1. The document must start with `{`, not with `[`, as we have key-value pairs inside.\n",

    "4. `:` are missing after `phonenumbers`.\n",
    "5. `212-3242` is an invalid number, to include the dash it would need to be a string.\n",
    "6. `\"phone\": \"545-4568\"` can not be an element in an array, it has to be part of an object (inside `{ }`).\n",

    "### Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Elements**  \n",
    "   - **Top-Level**: An XML document must have exactly **one** root element, hence \"yes (once)\".  \n",
    "   - **Between Element Tags**: Child elements can appear within another element, so \"yes\".  \n",
    "   - **Inside Opening Element Tag**: Not possible; elements cannot be nested in the start tag itself, so \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attributes**  \n",
    "   - **Top-Level**: Standalone attributes (not inside an element) are not allowed, so \"no\".  \n",
    "   - **Between Element Tags**: Attributes cannot exist outside of a start tag, so \"no\".  \n",
    "   - **Inside Opening Element Tag**: This is where attributes belong (e.g., `<myElement attr=\"value\">`), so \"yes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text**  \n",
    "   - **Top-Level**: Outside the single root element, only whitespace may be allowed, but not text content in general, so \"no\".  \n",
    "   - **Between Element Tags**: Text content typically appears within elements, so \"yes\".  \n",
    "   - **Inside Opening Element Tag**: Not allowed; only attributes can be placed there, so \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comments**  \n",
    "   - **Top-Level**: Comments can be placed before or after the root element, or even outside of it, so \"yes\".  \n",
    "   - **Between Element Tags**: Comments are allowed between elements (e.g., `<!-- comment -->`), so \"yes\".  \n",
    "   - **Inside Opening Element Tag**: Comments cannot appear in the middle of a start tag, so \"no\"."

    "## 4. XML vs CSV - the limits of tables for heterogeneous data (Optional)\n",
    "If your document consists of a collection of heterogeneous objects with different attributes, XML/JSON turns out to be more suited than a comma-separated format to store the data. In this exercise we want to show that denormalization is a good idea in this setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the following XML document representing a collection of products available in an online shop selling all kinds of products. In this product catalog each product has different attributes. You are asked to turn this data into a CSV file.\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<productscatalog>\n",
    "    <product>\n",
    "        <id> 1 </id>\n",
    "        <category> BBQ </category>\n",
    "        <type> Gas </type>\n",
    "        <height> 120cm </height>\n",
    "    </product>\n",
    "    <product>\n",
    "        <id> 2 </id>\n",
    "        <category> notebook </category>\n",

    "1, category, BBQ\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What are the disadvantages of the CSV format compared to the XML format in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first solution:\n",
    "We have different attributes for each category of products, so most of the columns in the table are empty. The resulting table is extremely sparse and not easily humanly readable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the second solution: \n",
    "It is not convenient to read with several lines for the same product. You have to store the id multiple times. And you need to make sure the table is sorted by id if you want to see all the attributes for one product as a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other problem: if we have a lot of nested attributes it can be cumbersome to put them in the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe or give an example of one use case where the CSV format would be more appropriate than the XML format\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If all the rows have the same (fixed set) of attributes and there is no nesting, it is more natural to describe the data as a table.\n"
