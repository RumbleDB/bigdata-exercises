    "### Do the following to set up an HBase cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** we want you to use a small but real cluster for running HBase rather than a single machine. But, these clusters burn Azure credit very quickly&mdash;the cheapest configuration consumes roughly **1 CHF per hour, which is a lot relative to your overall credit**&mdash;so it is very important for you to <font color=\"red\">**DELETE**</font> your cluster once you are done. Luckily, it is possible to keep your data intact when you delete a cluster, and see it again when you recreate it; we will touch upon this in the process. Now, let's start.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Please first make sure you accept our lab assignment invitation sent to the email address you have been using for Azure. And configure the subscription in Azure so that you can see the HBase credit assignment under the Subscription name.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In Azure portal click the \"+ Create a Resource\" button on the left, type \"hdinsight\" in the search box, and select \"Azure HDInsight\". Go ahead and click on \"Create\". HDInsight is Microsoft's cloud service which wraps Hadoop, HBase, Spark and other Big Data technologies; read more [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/).<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://bigdata2020exassets.blob.core.windows.net/ex05/1.Azure_Hbase_1.png\" style=\"width:500px;\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Azure requires users to register their subscriptions to enable the usage of \"Microsoft.HDInsight\" resource. Note that to get to the registration page, you need to try to create an HBase cluster. Then you will see the \"This subscription is not registered for HDInsight...\" message. Make sure you click to the registration page and search for \"hdinsight\" and register. It takes less than 1 minute to finish registration and refresh both in Azure and your browser to confirm that the registration has been done. <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://bigdata2020exassets.blob.core.windows.net/ex05/2.HDInsight_registration.png\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Now refresh the page of \"Create HDInsight cluster\" and you will be able to use the Week 5 subscription. Choose the Resource group, Cluster name, Region, Cluster type as indicated in the screenshot and set your login password. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "4. The canonical way would be to use an HDFS cluster as a storage layer for an HBase cluster, but we will be using the Blob service of Windows Azure Storage for this purpose. This has a significant advantage of allowing you to delete your HBase cluster without losing the data: you can recreate the cluster using the same Azure Storage Account and the same container and you will see the same data. This is useful, for example, if you don't have time to finish this exercise in one sitting: you can just delete your cluster, recreate it later, and continue your work. \n",
    "Azure storage is selected by default (see the screenshot). If you go to the \"Storage\" tag, under \"Primary storage account\", Azure creates already a storage account and assigns a container to it. \n",
    "**Important: if you are recreating your HBase cluster and want to see the existing data, also choose the cluster in the same region as last time, then choose \"Select existing\" and set the container name to the one that you see in the \"Storage Accounts\" tab of Azure&mdash;by default Azure generates a new container name every time you create a cluster, which then points to a different container.** Leave everything else as it is and click \"Next\".<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://bigdata2020exassets.blob.core.windows.net/ex05/3.Azure_HBase_storage.png\" style=\"width:500px;\"/><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now we need to choose the configuration of the nodes in our HBase cluster. It will be enough to have only 2 RegionServers (see the screenshot). As for the node size, let us be wise and select the economical option: for Head node choose \"E2 V3\"; for Zookeeper node choose \"D1 v2\"; for Region node choose \"E2 V3\". Zookeeper is a [distributed coordination service](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) used by HBase. Click \"Review+Create\".<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "6. In the last step, \"Summary\", check if the settings are as you intend. These clusters are expensive, so it is worth checking the price estimate at this step: for me it is 0.96 CHF/hour; if your price is larger than this, check your node sizes and counts. When done, initiate the cluster creation by clicking \"Create\". The process will take time, around 15&mdash;25 minutes; in my own case it took 15 minutes."

But in this exercise, we will interact with the HBase cluster through the command-line interface. For this, you will need to run the `ssh` program in a terminal in order to connect to your cluster. There are three options of how you can do this:\n",
    "1. **On your own machine** you can just use a normal terminal if you have `ssh` installed. Linux usually has it, as does MacOS. Windows doesn't have it by default (perhaps Win10 does, though), but Windows users can use the browser-based option, which is described next, and the other option is to install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).\n",

    "Let's start with summarizing what we have in memory when working with HBase: MemStore, LRU (Least Recently Used) BlockCache, Indices of HFiles, and Bloom Filters. We did not have time to cover it in the lecture, but bloom filters are actually very crucial in avoiding disk reads if we can guarantee that a key is **not** in an HFile. Bloom filters allow us to very quickly determine whether an element belongs to a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom filters are a data structure used to speed up queries, useful in the case in which it's likely that the value we are looking doesn't exist in the collection we are querying. Their main component is a bit array with all values initially set to 0. When a new element is inserted in the collection, its value is first run through a certain number of (fixed) hash functions, and the locations in the bit array corresponding to the outputs of these functions are set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when we query for a certain value, if the value has previously been inserted in the collection then all the locations corresponding to the hash function outputs will certainly already have been set to 1. On the contrary, if the element hasn't been previously inserted, then the locations may or may not have already been set to 1 by other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if prior to accessing the collection we run our queried value through the hash functions, check the locations corresponding to the outputs, and find any of them to be 0, we are guaranteed that the element is not present in the collection (No False Negatives), and we don't have to waste time looking. If the corresponding locations are all set to 1, the element may or may not be present in the collection (Possibility of False Positives), but in the worst case we're just wasting time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect the following examples. Say we have hash functions that map the input `John Smith` and `Mary Smith` to the bit array `011001110000`. When we have a new input `Albert Einstein` which is mapped by the same hash functions to the bit array `011001110000`. This clearly does not correspond to the bit array produced by the previous two inputs. Hence, we can say that `Albert Einstein` is not in the set which `John Smith` and `Mary Smith` belong to (denoted as `{the Smiths}` for short). However, another input `Louis de Broglie` whose bit array after hashing is `011001110000` is then a false positive for the set `{the Smiths}`. \n",

Note HBase block is not to be confused with HDFS block and the underlying file system block, see [here](https://blog.cloudera.com/hbase-blockcache-101/#3) for a good discussion.
